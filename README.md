Description
============
Raindrops fall from the sky at certain intervals. A bucket that moves across the screen catches the raindrops. For each raindrop that is caught, the score increases by one. If the score reaches 20, the game is over (YOU WIN!). For every raindrop missed, the amount of lives is decreased by 1. If the lives reaches 0, the game is over and you lose the game.
